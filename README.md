# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Grace Christenbery

I'm a passionate software engineer with a strong interest in **data visualization**, **machine learning**, **robotics**, and **embedded systems**. I have experience working across several domains, including **FinTech**, **Data Visualization/Graphics Programming**, **Robotics**, and **Bioinformatics**. 

## Skills & Interests

- **Software Engineering**: Building scalable and high-performance systems
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring machine learning algorithms and data-driven insights
- **Embedded Systems**: Designing and developing for resource-constrained devices
- **FinTech**: Developing financial technology solutions in industry
- **Data Visualization & Graphics Programming**: Creating intuitive and visually appealing data-driven applications
- **Robotics**: Robotics is the study and practice of designing, building, and using robots. In the past, I developed code to control a Nao robot with Leap Motion gestures.
- **Bioinformatics**: Applying computational techniques to biological data. I've developed graphics/data visualization software for researchers at MIT, MIT Lincoln Laboratory, UC Berkeley, and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

## Current Goals

- Fill out this GitHub more and make my contribution history consistently green by working on learning/passion/hobby projects.
- Continue exploring **machine learning** and **embedded systems** through personal projects.
- Build more **interactive web applications** with modern frameworks like **React**, **Angular**, and **Spring Boot**.

Feel free to explore my repositories, check out my projects, and connect with me!
